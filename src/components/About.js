            With a strong background in maths and economics, I've developed an
            eternal and insatiable search for efficiency. During my time at
            Microverse, I've worked with +20 people from all over the world
            developing on more than 20 projects. Gitflow, code reviews, stand up
            meetings and problems solving were part of my daily structure for
            almost a year.

            Iâ€™m currently seeking a new opportunity for web development. I'd
